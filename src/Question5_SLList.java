/*
5 (code) [30 points] Implement a version of your AList, SLList, and DLList that uses generics and would
work with any type of object and not only Song

Example: Starting with an empty AList songsList = new AList();

A call to songsList.toString() returns:
Empty List

After the following calls:
songsList.addy(song1);
songsList.addy(song3);
songsList.addy(song2);
songsList.addy(song1);

A call to songsList.toString(list) returns:
{ songName: Coral Crown, artist: Darren Korb, price: 4.07 }
{ songName: CASANOVE POSSE, artist: ALI, price: 4.00 }
{ songName: El Pibe De Mi Barrio, artist: Dr. Krapula, price: 2.47 }
{ songName: Coral Crown, artist: Darren Korb, price: 4.07 }

After the following calls:
songList.removy(1); // removes element at index 1

A call to songsList.toString(list) returns:
{ songName: Coral Crown, artist: Darren Korb, price: 4.07 }
{ songName: El Pibe De Mi Barrio, artist: Dr. Krapula, price: 2.47 }
{ songName: Coral Crown, artist: Darren Korb, price: 4.07 }
Note: The example above must produce the same output after replacing the type of the songsList from
Alist to SLList or DLList.
